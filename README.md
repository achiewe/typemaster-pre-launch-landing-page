## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improve a lot about the placing of elements within the page. i used many times flexbox, especially display:flex. also i started using :root and css variables, which gave me  opportunity to create with local scope. instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, finally i  could placed them in variables.

## continued development
I wish further develop my skills with css in terms of grid and flexbox as I feel they will give me advantage to complete the project more easily.
